# AI Agent Meta-Optimization Framework

A minimalist framework for developing and optimizing AI agents through automated prompt engineering. The core thesis is that manually coding complex agent behaviors and hand-tuning prompts doesn't scale - instead, we should create minimal, flexible frameworks that let AI optimize itself.

## Philosophy

Most AI agent development time is spent on:

1. Debugging complex agent execution steps
2. Manual prompt engineering and tuning
3. Writing intricate code to handle edge cases

This framework takes a different approach:

1. Implement the simplest possible agent loop
2. Make every decision point prompt-driven and tunable
3. Let AI optimize the prompts

## Basic Usage

The simplest way to run an agent is through the CLI:
```bash
python main.py
```

## Installation

```bash
# Dependencies will be listed here
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Project Tree

```bash
agent/
â”œâ”€â”€ lib/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ base.py      # Core agent implementation
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ debug.py     # Debug decorator and logging
â”œâ”€â”€ agents/          # Specific agent implementations
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ agent1/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ agent.py           # Agent implementation
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ variables/         # Runtime variables and prompts
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ agent2/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ agent.py
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ variables/
â”œâ”€â”€ main.py         # Main runner with CLI interface
â””â”€â”€ requirements.txt
```

## Quick Agent Generation

If you're using an AI-powered editor, use this prompt to generate your agent's code structure:

```
You will help to generate a new agent implementation by:
1. Reading and analyzing:
   - The full README (DO NOT SKIP ANYTHING!)
   - The full implementation of lib/base.py to understand the core Agent class
   - Existing agents in agents/ directory for implementation patterns

2. Creating the following structure:
   - agent.py (extending lib.base.Agent with required methods)
   - variables/ directory (empty)

Read and analyse the files in their entirety first. Then ask me questions iteratively about what I want the agent to do. Keep asking follow-up questions until you have a crystal clear understanding of what I want. Ask one question at a time.

IMPORTANT:
- Use ONLY standard library modules unless absolutely necessary
- Keep implementation simple and minimal
- Do not add external dependencies without explicit justification
- Tools MUST follow the format => <TOOL: TOOL_NAME>optional_tool_input</TOOL>
- For arguments with no promptable defaults, prefer user input, by using the base ask_user tool - `<TOOL: ASK_USER>What is the |input_var|?</TOOL>`
```

## Setting Up Runtime Variables
All variable files in the `variables/` directory must be JSON files with a specific format:
- Content must be a JSON array containing a single string
- The string contains the entire content/instructions/prompt
- No additional fields or nested objects are allowed

Example format:
```json
[
  "You are an agent that does X. Your instructions are:\n1. Do this\n2. Then do that\n\nWhen responding:\n- Format like this\n- Include these details"
]
```

To set up your agent's variables:

1. Create a `variables/` directory in your agent's folder
2. Create your JSON files (e.g. `manifesto.json`) following the format above
3. Use this prompt to generate the content for your files:
```
Read the README.

Analyze the newly generated agent.py to understand:
- What tools the agent uses
- What runtime variables it references
- Its core behavior and requirements

Then generate copyable JSON content for manifesto.json:
- Use EXACT format: ["content"]
- All newlines as \\n
- All quotes as \\\"
- Output as a single line with NO formatting
- NO explanations or markdown - just the raw JSON array
- Content must define:
  * Agent personality and behavior
  * All tools available to the agent
  * EXACT tool call formats with proper escaping, (IMPORTANT! MUST INCLUDE IN MANIFESTO THAT TOOL CALLS FOLLOW THE FORMAT => <TOOL:TOOL_NAME>optional_tool_input</TOOL> MUST REMEMBER THE CLOSING TAG!!!!)
  * Must include that the agent may only call 1 tool at a time in the manifesto
  * Response format requirements
  * Any other runtime requirements
Note: if there is no end_detection defined, the agent will end if no tool is called! So keep that in mind when generating the manifesto.

After that, generate copyable JSON content for other variables, following the same format.
```

<summary>ðŸ¤– Agent Implementation Guidelines (click to expand)</summary>

If you're an AI you MUST follow these guidelines below to implement an agent:

## Agent Architecture Guidelines

Each agent in the `agents/` directory follows a modular architecture designed for prompt engineering and automated generation:

1. **Core Architecture**:
   - Each agent is a specialized extension of `lib.base.Agent`
   - Tools are defined as pure functions: `Dict[str, Callable[[str], str]]`
   - Memory and state management handled by base agent
   - All configuration through constructor, no global state

2. **Tool Protocol**:
   - Tools are stateless functions that take string input and return string output
   - Tool calls must use XML format: `<TOOL: TOOL_NAME>arguments</TOOL>`
   - Multi-line arguments are supported through the XML format
   - Tools should be pure functions with no side effects

3. **State Management**:
   - Runtime state (prompts, inputs) stored in `variables/`
   - ALL JSON files use array format `[content]` for prompt engineering
   - Variables directory designed for automated prompt optimization
   - Each agent manages own memory compression strategy

4. **Execution**:
   - Runners handle all I/O and environment setup
   - Agents receive clean inputs through constructor
   - Environment variables (API keys etc) handled by runner
   - All methods decorated with `@debug()` for monitoring

5. **Prompt Engineering**:
   - Manifesto defines agent personality and tool protocols
   - JSON array format enables automated prompt optimization
   - Each agent can define custom end conditions
   - Tool formats defined in manifesto, not hardcoded

6. **Error Handling**:
   - Required parameters validated in constructor
   - Environment variables checked before agent creation
   - Tools must handle their own errors gracefully
   - Memory compression handled by base agent

7. **Extensibility**:
   - New agents inherit core functionality from base
   - Tool sets can be mixed: external APIs and internal functions
   - Custom tool detection patterns per agent
   - Memory management customizable per agent

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style

- No default/hardcoded values for required parameters in variables folder
- All variables defined in variables folder must be explicitly passed
- No default/hardcoded values for required parameters in agent constructor
- Clear documentation of all required parameters

## Agent Implementation Guidelines

Each agent in the `agents/` directory MUST follow these conventions:

1. **Directory Structure**:
   - Agent directory name should be descriptive (e.g., `research_agent`, `text_summary_agent`)
   - Main implementation MUST be in `agent.py` (not named after the agent)
   - MUST have `run/runner.py` for running the agent
   - MUST have `variables/` directory for runtime state

2. **Variables Format**:
   - ALL JSON files in `variables/` MUST use array indexing `[0]`, not dictionary keys
   - Example: `{"text": "content"}` is WRONG, `["content"]` is CORRECT
   - `manifesto.json` MUST exist and follow this format

3. **Runner**:
   - MUST read all variables using array index `[0]`
   - Example: `json.load(f)[0]` not `json.load(f)["key"]`
   - MUST handle all file I/O, agent implementation should only take clean inputs

4. **Agent Implementation**:
   - CRITICAL: Before implementing any agent methods:
     1. Read and understand the base Agent class in `lib/base.py` first
     2. Match ALL method signatures EXACTLY as defined in base Agent class
     3. Pay special attention to tool detection and end detection interfaces
   - MUST inherit from `lib.base.Agent`
   - MUST NOT read files directly, all inputs through constructor
   - MUST use `@debug()` decorator on all methods
   - MUST implement `_detect_tool` and `_end_detection`
   - MUST follow naming convention: directory `xxx_agent` (e.g. `research_agent`) and class `XxxAgent` (e.g. `ResearchAgent`)
