DeepSeek-R1 is a state-of-the-art reasoning model designed to achieve performance comparable to other leading models like OpenAI's o1 across various tasks such as math, code, and reasoning. Developed by DeepSeek-AI, it involves advanced techniques like large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) without supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a preliminary step. This approach allows models like DeepSeek-R1-Zero to encourage reasoning capabilities purely through RL, demonstrating breakthroughs such as self-verification, reflection, and generating comprehensive chains of thought.

DeepSeek-R1 improves upon the challenges faced with earlier models, like repetition and readability issues, by incorporating a cold-start data approach before applying RL. This model, along with multiple distilled versions based on architectures like Llama and Qwen, achieves better performance, establishing new benchmarks for dense models.

The DeepSeek-R1 series, including the distilled variants like DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B, are open-source and support commercial use. The models are tested widely across a range of benchmarks and exhibit superior performance in various tasks compared to other leading models.

You can interact with DeepSeek-R1 on DeepSeek's official website, chat.deepseek.com, or utilize their API on the DeepSeek Platform. For more technical details, the model's code is available on GitHub and covered under an MIT License.

Tool Result [We introduce our first-generation reasoning models, DeepSeek-R1-Zero and DeepSeek-R1. DeepSeek-R1-Zero, a model trained via large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) without supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a preliminary step, demonstrated remarkable performance on reasoning. With RL, DeepSeek-R1-Zero naturally emerged with numerous powerful and interesting reasoning behaviors. However, DeepSeek-R1-Zero encounters challenges such as endless repetition, poor readability, and language mixing. To address these issues and further enhance reasoning performance, we introduce DeepSeek-R1, which incorporates cold-start data before RL. DeepSeek-R1 achieves performance comparable to OpenAI-o1 across math, code, and reasoning tasks. To support the research community, we have open-sourced DeepSeek-R1-Zero, DeepSeek-R1, and six dense models distilled from DeepSeek-R1 based on Llama and Qwen. DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B outperforms OpenAI-o1-mini across various benchmarks, achieving new state-of-the-art results for dense models.
NOTE: Before running DeepSeek-R1 series models locally, we kindly recommend reviewing the Usage Recommendation section.
Post-Training: Large-Scale Reinforcement Learning on the Base Model
-
We directly apply reinforcement learning (RL) to the base model without relying on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a preliminary step. This approach allows the model to explore chain-of-thought (CoT) for solving complex problems, resulting in the development of DeepSeek-R1-Zero. DeepSeek-R1-Zero demonstrates capabilities such as self-verification, reflection, and generating long CoTs, marking a significant milestone for the research community. Notably, it is the first open research to validate that reasoning capabilities of LLMs can be incentivized purely through RL, without the need for SFT. This breakthrough paves the way for future advancements in this area.
-
We introduce our pipeline to develop DeepSeek-R1. The pipeline incorporates two RL stages aimed at discovering improved reasoning patterns and aligning with human preferences, as well as two SFT stages that serve as the seed for the model's reasoning and non-reasoning capabilities. We believe the pipeline will benefit the industry by creating better models.
Distillation: Smaller Models Can Be Powerful Too
- We demonstrate that the reasoning patterns of larger models can be distilled into smaller models, resulting in better performance compared to the reasoning patterns discovered through RL on small models. The open source DeepSeek-R1, as well as its API, will benefit the research community to distill better smaller models in the future.
- Using the reasoning data generated by DeepSeek-R1, we fine-tuned several dense models that are widely used in the research community. The evaluation results demonstrate that the distilled smaller dense models perform exceptionally well on benchmarks. We open-source distilled 1.5B, 7B, 8B, 14B, 32B, and 70B checkpoints based on Qwen2.5 and Llama3 series to the community.

NOTE: Hugging Face's Transformers has not been directly supported yet.
DeepSeek-R1-Distill models can be utilized in the same manner as Qwen or Llama models.
For instance, you can easily start a service using vLLM:
vllm serve deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B --tensor-parallel-size 2 --max-model-len 32768 --enforce-eager
You can also easily start a service using SGLang
python3 -m sglang.launch_server --model deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B --trust-remote-code --tp 2
We recommend adhering to the following configurations when utilizing the DeepSeek-R1 series models, including benchmarking, to achieve the expected performance:
- Set the temperature within the range of 0.5-0.7 (0.6 is recommended) to prevent endless repetitions or incoherent outputs.
- Avoid adding a system prompt; all instructions should be contained within the user prompt.
- For mathematical problems, it is advisable to include a directive in your prompt such as: "Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \boxed{}."
- When evaluating model performance, it is recommended to conduct multiple tests and average the results.
Additionally, we have observed that the DeepSeek-R1 series models tend to bypass thinking pattern (i.e., outputting "<think>\n\n</think>") when responding to certain queries, which can adversely affect the model's performance. To ensure that the model engages in thorough reasoning, we recommend enforcing the model to initiate its response with "<think>\n" at the beginning of every output.
