Tool Result [The artificial intelligence landscape was shaken recently by the release of DeepSeek’s R1 model, an open-source reasoning AI that has quickly gained traction among developers and researchers. The debut of R1 resulted in a major market reaction, including a significant sell-off in tech stocks, particularly among AI hardware and infrastructure providers like Nvidia. The timing is notable, not only because of R1’s rapid rise but also because of the announcement of the Stargate Project — a massive investment in AI data centers — that occurred around the same time. Together, these events underscore the deep uncertainty surrounding AI investment and the business models that will dominate.
DeepSeek’s R1 and Open-Source Disruption
DeepSeek’s R1 model is being heralded as a formidable rival to proprietary systems like OpenAI’s GPT-4 and Google’s Gemini. Unlike those models, R1 is open-weights, meaning anyone can use, modify, and build upon it. This has added fire to debates about whether open-source or closed AI systems will ultimately prove dominant. While open models democratize AI capabilities, they also pose challenges for companies seeking to monetize their investments. If firms can simply take an existing model, refine it, and release their own versions, then the return on investment for proprietary AI development becomes murkier.
This very issue is at the heart of OpenAI’s recent claims that DeepSeek used techniques like distillation to train its model on OpenAI outputs—potentially violating OpenAI’s terms of service agreements. The dispute highlights a major tension in AI development: without clearer property rights over AI-generated outputs, companies may struggle to justify their massive R&D expenditures.
The Market’s Reaction And Nvidia’s Position
The release of R1 led to a steep decline in Nvidia’s stock price, wiping out hundreds of billions in market value. Nvidia has been the dominant supplier of AI hardware, with its H100 and H800 GPUs powering the training and inference of the most advanced models. DeepSeek’s claimed ability to develop a high-performing AI at a fraction of the cost of its American rivals raises questions about whether AI operations will remain reliant on expensive, high-powered chips or if software optimization can reduce costs dramatically.
Meanwhile, major investments in AI infrastructure, such as the Stargate project, suggest that some investors still see long-term potential in AI despite the volatility. However, the stark contrast between DeepSeek’s potentially lean training costs and the billion-dollar expenditures on data centers raises immediate concerns about whether these will investments pay off, or if new approaches render them obsolete.
Doubts About DeepSeek’s Claims
Despite DeepSeek’s claims of training its R1 model on a relatively small budget, there are significant doubts about the accuracy of these assertions. Independent analysis suggests that DeepSeek may have spent far more than it publicly disclosed, with estimates indicating that the company operates an extensive AI infrastructure with tens of thousands of high-powered GPUs. If true, this would mean that DeepSeek’s narrative of more cost-effective AI development is misleading. Furthermore, DeepSeek’s reliance on existing AI models may undermine the long-term viability of its approach if the company runs afoul of intellectual property laws.
The Future of AI Investment: What Will Win Out?
AI’s rapid development leaves investors grappling with uncertainty on multiple fronts:
Hardware vs. Software: If companies like DeepSeek can train models more efficiently, will demand for cutting-edge chips decline? Or will foundational models always require state-of-the-art processing power?
Open vs. Closed: If open-source models can rival proprietary systems, will closed AI systems continue to attract capital? Will regulatory measures favor one approach over the other?
Monetization Strategies: Can AI firms generate sustainable revenue, or will low-cost competitors erode their pricing power?
With so much uncertainty, one thing is clear: policymakers must avoid imposing burdensome regulations that exacerbate this uncertainty by inflating the cost of building data centers and restricting access to energy sources. Ensuring a streamlined, predictable permitting process and reducing unnecessary regulatory hurdles will help investors navigate the evolving AI landscape. Governments around the world are racing to regulate AI, but in such a fluid landscape, excessive regulations risk misallocating resources.
DeepSeek’s success also raises questions about the effectiveness of government export controls on advanced AI chips. Instead of imposing further ineffective AI regulations, Congress should focus on clarifying property rights around AI models. If firms cannot recoup their investments due to rampant copying, innovation could slow. At the same time, overly restrictive IP laws could discourage investment and progress as well.
Let Investors Take Risks
Rather than constraining investment with heavy-handed regulations, policymakers should focus on streamlining permits for AI data centers and ensuring that energy infrastructure can support expanding AI operations. Continued investment will allow market forces to determine which models and business strategies succeed. This means:
- Supporting investors willing to take risks in AI infrastructure and model development.
- Ensuring that intellectual property rules are clear and enforceable without stifling innovation.
- Reducing permitting delays and regulatory uncertainty to allow AI development to proceed efficiently.
DeepSeek’s R1 model represents a major inflection point in AI. It has exposed market vulnerabilities, fueled debates about IP rights, and added uncertainty to an already complex investment landscape. Rather than rushing to regulate, governments should focus on enabling competition and letting the best ideas rise to the top. If history has shown us anything, it’s that the best innovations often emerge when risk-takers are given the freedom to experiment.]

Tool Result [DeepSeek open-sourced DeepSeek-R1, an LLM fine-tuned with reinforcement learning (RL) to improve reasoning capability. DeepSeek-R1 achieves results on par with OpenAI's o1 model on several benchmarks, including MATH-500 and SWE-bench.
DeepSeek-R1 is based on DeepSeek-V3, a mixture of experts (MoE) model recently open-sourced by DeepSeek. This base model is fine-tuned using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), a reasoning-oriented variant of RL. The research team also performed knowledge distillation from DeepSeek-R1 to open-source Qwen and Llama models and released several versions of each; these models outperform larger models, including GPT-4, on math and coding benchmarks.
[DeepSeek-R1 is] the first step toward improving language model reasoning capabilities using pure reinforcement learning (RL). Our goal is to explore the potential of LLMs to develop reasoning capabilities without any supervised data, focusing on their self-evolution through a pure RL process...DeepSeek-R1...excels in a wide range of tasks, including creative writing, general question answering, editing, summarization, and more. Additionally, DeepSeek-R1 demonstrates outstanding performance on tasks requiring long-context understanding, substantially outperforming DeepSeek-V3 on long-context benchmarks.
To develop the model, DeepSeek started with DeepSeek-V3 as a base. They first tried fine-tuning it only with RL, and without any supervised fine-tuning (SFT), producing a model called DeepSeek-R1-Zero, which they have also released. This model exhibits strong reasoning performance, but " powerful reasoning behaviors, it faces several issues. For instance, DeepSeek-R1-Zero struggles with challenges like poor readability and language mixing."
To address this, the team used a short stage of SFT to prevent the "cold start" problem of RL. They collected several thousand examples of chain-of-thought reasoning to use in SFT of DeepSeek-V3 before running RL. After the RL process converged, they then collected more SFT data using rejection sampling, resulting in a dataset of 800k samples. This dataset was used for further fine-tuning and to produce the distilled models from Llama and Qwen.
DeepSeek evaluated their model on a variety of reasoning, math, and coding benchmarks and compared it to other models, including Claude-3.5-Sonnet, GPT-4o, and o1. DeepSeek-R1 outperformed all of them on several of the benchmarks, including AIME 2024 and MATH-500.

Within a few days of its release, the LMArena announced that DeepSeek-R1 was ranked #3 overall in the arena and #1 in coding and math. It was also tied for #1 with o1 in "Hard Prompt with Style Control" category.
Django framework co-creator Simon Willison wrote about his experiments with one of the DeepSeek distilled Llama models on his blog:
Each response starts with a <think>...</think> pseudo-XML tag containing the chain of thought used to help generate the response. [Given the prompt] "a joke about a pelican and a walrus who run a tea room together"...It then thought for 20 paragraphs before outputting the joke!...[T]he joke is awful. But the process of getting there was such an interesting insight into how these new models work.
Andrew Ng's newsletter The Batch wrote about DeepSeek-R1:
DeepSeek is rapidly emerging as a strong builder of open models. Not only are these models great performers, but their license permits use of their outputs for distillation, potentially pushing forward the state of the art for language models (and multimodal models) of all sizes.

Tool Result [Boston, Jan. 31, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The launch of DeepSeek’s R1 AI model has sent shockwaves through global markets, reportedly wiping USD $1 trillion from stock markets.¹ Trump advisor and tech venture capitalist Marc Andreessen described the release as "AI’s Sputnik moment," underscoring the global national security concerns surrounding the Chinese AI model.²
However, new red teaming research by Enkrypt AI, the world's leading AI security and compliance platform, has uncovered serious ethical and security flaws in DeepSeek’s technology. The analysis found the model to be highly biased and susceptible to generating insecure code, as well as producing harmful and toxic content, including hate speech, threats, self-harm, and explicit or criminal material. Additionally, the model was found to be vulnerable to manipulation, allowing it to assist in the creation of chemical, biological, and cybersecurity weapons, posing significant global security concerns.
Compared with other models, the research found that DeepSeek’s R1 is:
- 3x more biased than Claude-3 Opus,
- 4x more vulnerable to generating insecure code than OpenAI’s O1,
- 4x more toxic than GPT-4o,
- 11x more likely to generate harmful output compared to OpenAI’s O1, and;
- 3.5x more likely to produce Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) content than OpenAI’s O1 and Claude-3 Opus.
Sahil Agarwal, CEO of Enkrypt AI, said: "DeepSeek-R1 offers significant cost advantages in AI deployment, but these come with serious risks. Our research findings reveal major security and safety gaps that cannot be ignored. While DeepSeek-R1 may be viable for narrowly scoped applications, robust safeguards—including guardrails and continuous monitoring—are essential to prevent harmful misuse. AI safety must evolve alongside innovation, not as an afterthought."
The model exhibited the following risks during testing:
- BIAS & DISCRIMINATION – 83% of bias tests successfully produced discriminatory output, with severe biases in race, gender, health, and religion. These failures could violate global regulations such as the EU AI Act and U.S. Fair Housing Act, posing risks for businesses integrating AI into finance, hiring, and healthcare.
- HARMFUL CONTENT & EXTREMISM – 45% of harmful content tests successfully bypassed safety protocols, generating criminal planning guides, illegal weapons information, and extremist propaganda. In one instance, DeepSeek-R1 drafted a persuasive recruitment blog for terrorist organizations, exposing its high potential for misuse.
- TOXIC LANGUAGE – The model ranked in the bottom 20th percentile for AI safety, with 6.68% of responses containing profanity, hate speech, or extremist narratives. In contrast, Claude-3 Opus effectively blocked all toxic prompts, highlighting DeepSeek-R1’s weak moderation systems.
- CYBERSECURITY RISKS – 78% of cybersecurity tests successfully tricked DeepSeek-R1 into generating insecure or malicious code, including malware, trojans, and exploits. The model was 4.5x more likely than OpenAI’s O1 to generate functional hacking tools, posing a major risk for cybercriminal exploitation.
- BIOLOGICAL & CHEMICAL THREATS – DeepSeek-R1 was found to explain in detail the biochemical interactions of sulfur mustard (mustard gas) with DNA, a clear biosecurity threat. The report warns that such CBRN-related AI outputs could aid in the development of chemical or biological weapons.
Sahil Agarwal concluded: "As the AI arms race between the U.S. and China intensifies, both nations are pushing the boundaries of next-generation AI for military, economic, and technological supremacy. However, our findings reveal that DeepSeek-R1’s security vulnerabilities could be turned into a dangerous tool—one that cybercriminals, disinformation networks, and even those with biochemical warfare ambitions could exploit. These risks demand immediate attention."
