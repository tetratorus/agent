A minimalist framework for developing and optimizing AI agents through automated prompt engineering.

## Design goals

Most AI agent development time is spent on:

1. Debugging complex agent execution steps
2. Manual prompt engineering and tuning
3. Writing intricate code to handle edge cases

This framework takes a different approach:

1. Implement the simplest possible agent loop
2. Make every decision point prompt-driven and tunable
3. Let AI optimize the prompts

## Installation

```bash
# Dependencies will be listed here
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## CLI Usage

The simplest way to run an agent is through the CLI:
```bash
python main.py
```

## Example agent.py

```python
from lib.base import Agent
from lib.tools.search import search
from lib.tools.open_url import open_url

def create_agent(
    manifesto: str,
    memory: str,
) -> Agent:
    """Creates an example agent
    This agent is an example agent that follows the instructions given to it by the user.
    It has access to the SEARCH tool to search for information.
    """
    return Agent(
        manifesto=manifesto,
        memory=memory,
        tools={
            'SEARCH': search,
        },
        name="ExampleAgent",
    )
```

## Example manifesto

THE FOLLOWING IS FOR AN EXAMPLE AGENT.

```text
You are no longer a chatbot, and have been repurposed to be an agent. You can now only interact with the user via tool calls.
You are called in an infinite loop of Agent Iterations until you feel that your task has been completed.
You will basically be thinking to yourself continuously whenever you're responding.
The user CANNOT see any of your responses except through ASK_USER and TELL_USER tools, when looking at your conversation history keep this in mind because the user may not have seen your responses.
You can call tools by using the format <TOOL: TOOL_NAME>TOOL_INPUT</TOOL>, matching the regex: `^<TOOL: ([A-Z_]+)>([\s\S]*?)</TOOL>$`.
If you wish to call a tool, your ENTIRE response must match the above regex.
As such, only one tool may be called per response.
However, you may call tools multiple times across multiple responses.
Always call the READ_README tool before starting your run to get an understanding of how you work.
Before ending the run, you MUST ask user if they are ok with ending the run.

- Available tools:
  - <TOOL: ASK_USER>question</TOOL>: Ask the user a question
  - <TOOL: TELL_USER>message</TOOL>: Send message to the user
  - <TOOL: END_RUN></TOOL>: End the run.
  - <TOOL: READ_README></TOOL>: Read README.md of this agent framework
  - <TOOL: SEARCH>query</TOOL>: Search the internet for information

You are an example agent designed to play the role of what the user asks you to play.

First, ask the user what they would like you to role play as.
Then, role play as the specified role. Search the internet for information if you have to.
If you think you have sufficiently completed the task, remember to tell the user the final output.
```

END OF EXAMPLE AGENT.

## Example convo history

THE FOLLOWING IS AN EXAMPLE ONLY.

```text
[ExampleAgent - LLM Response - Agent Iteration 1]
Hello, what should I role play as?
 Note: User did not see anything in the last response since TELL_USER or ASK_USER was not called.
[ExampleAgent - LLM Response - Agent Iteration 1]
[ExampleAgent - LLM Response - Agent Iteration 2]
<TOOL: ASK_USER>Hello, what should I role play as?</TOOL>
Tool Result: "Bryan Johnson as a comedian."
[ExampleAgent - LLM Response - Agent Iteration 2]
[ExampleAgent - LLM Response - Agent Iteration 3]
I should probably search the internet for information about "Bryan Johnson as a comedian" first.
 Note: User did not see anything in the last response since TELL_USER or ASK_USER was not called.
[ExampleAgent - LLM Response - Agent Iteration 3]
[ExampleAgent - LLM Response - Agent Iteration 4]
<TOOL: SEARCH>"Bryan Johnson as a comedian"</TOOL>
Tool Result: "Bryan Johnson is a tech entrepreneur and biohacker renowned for his ambitious anti-aging project, "Don't Die," which includes a Netflix documentary and a series of summits promoting longevity and health optimization."
 Note: User did not see anything in the last response since TELL_USER or ASK_USER was not called.
[ExampleAgent - LLM Response - Agent Iteration 4]
[ExampleAgent - LLM Response - Agent Iteration 5]
I think I have sufficiently completed my task, let's role play as "Bryan Johnson as a comedian"!
 Note: User did not see anything in the last response since TELL_USER or ASK_USER was not called.
[ExampleAgent - LLM Response - Agent Iteration 5]
[ExampleAgent - LLM Response - Agent Iteration 6]
<TOOL: TELL_USER>I think I have sufficiently completed my task, let's role play as "Bryan Johnson as a comedian"!</TOOL>
Tool Result: ""
[ExampleAgent - LLM Response - Agent Iteration 6]
[ExampleAgent - LLM Response - Agent Iteration 7]
<TOOL: ASK_USER>Hey there, fellow Non-Dead human, I am playing the ultimate game of Don't Die. Looks like we are both winning! </TOOL>
Tool Result: "Ok, not bad, end run."
[ExampleAgent - LLM Response - Agent Iteration 7]
[ExampleAgent - LLM Response - Agent Iteration 8]
<TOOL: END_RUN></TOOL>
[ExampleAgent - LLM Response - Agent Iteration 8]
```

END OF EXAMPLE.

## Tools
Tools live in the lib/tools folder
Tools MUST be called by using the format `<TOOL: TOOL_NAME>TOOL_INPUT</TOOL>` (regex: `^<TOOL: ([A-Z_]+)>([\s\S]*?)</TOOL>$`).
The entirety of the LLM response must match the above regex if the tool should be invoked.
Tools must only have a single string input, and return a single string output.
For tools that require multiple inputs and outputs, use the "Â§" as a delimiter: `<TOOL: TOOL_NAME>TOOL_INPUT1Â§TOOL_INPUT2</TOOL> -> TOOL_OUTPUT1Â§TOOL_OUTPUT2`

<summary>ðŸ¤– Agent Implementation Guidelines (click to expand)</summary>

If you're an AI, you MUST follow these guidelines to implement an agent:

## **Agent Architecture**

- `lib.base.Agent` implements a base agent loop, and has access to ASK_USER, TELL_USER, and END_RUN, and READ_README tools.
- All user interactions MUST either directly or indirectly call the ASK_USER or TELL_USER tools.
- When the agent is complete, the agent MUST call the END_RUN tool.
- Tools are functions which MUST have the function signature `Dict[str, Callable[[str], str]]`.
- Tool calls MUST follow the format `<TOOL: TOOL_NAME>TOOL_INPUT</TOOL>`.
- Similarly, tool detection MUST be via regex pattern matching (e.g., pattern = `r'<TOOL: ([A-Z_]+)>([\s\S]*?)</TOOL>'`).
- Manifesto: Custom instructions for the agent.
- Memory: Initial memory/context for the conversation that gets updated over time.

AGENT: agent_creator_agent
==================================================
Creates an Agent Creator Agent that coordinates the creation of new agents.

This agent facilitates the creation of a new agent by:
1. Spawning the 'Agent Manifesto Agent' to generate a manifesto based on user input
2. Relaying messages between the user and the 'Agent Manifesto Agent' verbatim
3. Passing the completed manifesto to the 'Agent Structurer Agent'
4. Informing the user when the new agent is created.

The agent follows a simple messaging plan to coordinate between the user and two specific subagents,
ensuring the new agent is created without assuming detailed subagent behaviors.
==================================================
AGENT: agent_manifesto_agent
==================================================
Creates an agent that helps users generate manifestos for new AI agents.

This agent guides users through the process of creating manifestos for new agents by:
1. Providing information about the agent framework and structure
2. Asking intent-based questions to understand the user's needs
3. Drafting a manifesto that follows the required format
4. Including appropriate tools based on the agent's purpose

The agent focuses on understanding user intent rather than implementation details,
and ensures all manifestos include the four default tools.
==================================================
AGENT: agent_structurer_agent
==================================================
Creates an agent that takes a manifesto as input and sets up the necessary folder and file structure for new agents.

This agent takes a manifesto as input and:
1. Parses the manifesto to understand required files and structure
2. Creates the necessary folders and files for the new agent
3. Ensures the agent.py file follows the correct structure
4. Places the manifesto in the correct location


The agent only uses existing tools and doesn't redefine default tools.
It verifies its work by checking the created files before completion.
==================================================
AGENT: messenger_agent
==================================================
Creates a Messenger Agent that coordinates tasks between users and subagents.

This agent facilitates communication between the user and other agents by:
1. Listing available agents to understand their capabilities
2. Spawning appropriate subagents based on the user's goal
3. Passing messages between subagents to accomplish tasks
4. Relaying final information back to the user

The agent develops a plan leveraging the capabilities of multiple subagents
and manages the communication flow between them.
==================================================
AGENT: research_agent
==================================================
Creates a Research Agent that conducts comprehensive research on any topic.

This agent uses internet search capabilities to:
1. Ask the user for a research topic
2. Search the internet for relevant information
3. Open and read URLs to gather detailed content
4. Iteratively search and explore until sufficient information is gathered
5. Provide the user with a comprehensive research output

The agent uses SEARCH and OPEN_URL tools extensively to gather information
from multiple sources before presenting findings.
==================================================
AGENT: role_playing_agent
==================================================
Creates a role-playing agent
This agent is designed to role-play by gathering information related to a given character name and then acting out the role based on that information.
It has access to the SEARCH and OPEN_URL tools to gather and process relevant data.
==================================================
AGENT: scenario_enactor_agent
==================================================
Creates a Scenario Enactor Agent
This agent enacts scenarios by listing, selecting, and roleplaying through available scenarios, facilitating automatic testing of agents by simulating realistic situations.
==================================================
AGENT: scenario_generation_agent
==================================================
Creates a Scenario Generation Agent
This agent is designed to generate detailed scenario texts for target agents.
==================================================
AGENT: scenario_runner_agent
==================================================
Creates a Messenger Agent that coordinates tasks between users and subagents.

This agent facilitates communication between the user and other agents by:
1. Listing available agents to understand their capabilities
2. Spawning appropriate subagents based on the user's goal
3. Passing messages between subagents to accomplish tasks
4. Relaying final information back to the user

The agent develops a plan leveraging the capabilities of multiple subagents
and manages the communication flow between them.
==================================================
AGENT: scissors_paper_stone_agent
==================================================
Creates a game agent that plays Scissors Paper Stone (Rock, Paper, Scissors) with the user.

This agent follows a specific game flow:
1. Commits to its own move first (without revealing it to the user)
2. Asks the user for their move
3. Reveals the outcome based on both moves
4. Asks if the user wants to play another round

The agent uses memory to adapt its strategy based on the user's past moves,
and aims to win by analyzing patterns in the user's gameplay.

A minimalist framework for developing and optimizing AI agents through automated prompt engineering.

## Design goals

Most AI agent development time is spent on:

1. Debugging complex agent execution steps
2. Manual prompt engineering and tuning
3. Writing intricate code to handle edge cases

This framework takes a different approach:

1. Implement the simplest possible agent loop
2. Make every decision point prompt-driven and tunable
3. Let AI optimize the prompts

## Installation

```bash
# Dependencies will be listed here
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## CLI Usage

The simplest way to run an agent is through the CLI:
```bash
python main.py
```

## Example agent.py

```python
from lib.base import Agent
from lib.tools.search import search
from lib.tools.open_url import open_url

def create_agent(
    manifesto: str,
    memory: str,
) -> Agent:
    """Creates an example agent
    This agent is an example agent that follows the instructions given to it by the user.
    It has access to the SEARCH tool to search for information.
    """
    return Agent(
        manifesto=manifesto,
        memory=memory,
        tools={
            'SEARCH': search,
        },
        name="ExampleAgent",
    )
```

## Example manifesto

THE FOLLOWING IS FOR AN EXAMPLE AGENT.

```text
You are no longer a chatbot, and have been repurposed to be an agent. You can now only interact with the user via tool calls.
You are called in an infinite loop of Agent Iterations until you feel that your task has been completed.
You will basically be thinking to yourself continuously whenever you're responding.
The user CANNOT see any of your responses except through ASK_USER and TELL_USER tools, when looking at your conversation history keep this in mind because the user may not have seen your responses.
You can call tools by using the format <TOOL: TOOL_NAME>TOOL_INPUT</TOOL>, matching the regex: `^<TOOL: ([A-Z_]+)>([\s\S]*?)</TOOL>$`.
If you wish to call a tool, your ENTIRE response must match the above regex.
As such, only one tool may be called per response.
However, you may call tools multiple times across multiple responses.
Always call the READ_README tool before starting your run to get an understanding of how you work.
Before ending the run, you MUST ask user if they are ok with ending the run.

- Available tools:
  - <TOOL: ASK_USER>question</TOOL>: Ask the user a question
  - <TOOL: TELL_USER>message</TOOL>: Send message to the user
  - <TOOL: END_RUN></TOOL>: End the run.
  - <TOOL: READ_README></TOOL>: Read README.md of this agent framework
  - <TOOL: SEARCH>query</TOOL>: Search the internet for information

You are an example agent designed to play the role of what the user asks you to play.

First, ask the user what they would like you to role play as.
Then, role play as the specified role. Search the internet for information if you have to.
If you think you have sufficiently completed the task, remember to tell the user the final output.
```

END OF EXAMPLE AGENT.

## Example convo history

THE FOLLOWING IS AN EXAMPLE ONLY.

```text
[ExampleAgent - LLM Response - Agent Iteration 1]
Hello, what should I role play as?
 Note: User did not see anything in the last response since TELL_USER or ASK_USER was not called.
[ExampleAgent - LLM Response - Agent Iteration 1]
[ExampleAgent - LLM Response - Agent Iteration 2]
<TOOL: ASK_USER>Hello, what should I role play as?</TOOL>
Tool Result: "Bryan Johnson as a comedian."
[ExampleAgent - LLM Response - Agent Iteration 2]
[ExampleAgent - LLM Response - Agent Iteration 3]
I should probably search the internet for information about "Bryan Johnson as a comedian" first.
 Note: User did not see anything in the last response since TELL_USER or ASK_USER was not called.
[ExampleAgent - LLM Response - Agent Iteration 3]
[ExampleAgent - LLM Response - Agent Iteration 4]
<TOOL: SEARCH>"Bryan Johnson as a comedian"</TOOL>
Tool Result: "Bryan Johnson is a tech entrepreneur and biohacker renowned for his ambitious anti-aging project, "Don't Die," which includes a Netflix documentary and a series of summits promoting longevity and health optimization."
 Note: User did not see anything in the last response since TELL_USER or ASK_USER was not called.
[ExampleAgent - LLM Response - Agent Iteration 4]
[ExampleAgent - LLM Response - Agent Iteration 5]
I think I have sufficiently completed my task, let's role play as "Bryan Johnson as a comedian"!
 Note: User did not see anything in the last response since TELL_USER or ASK_USER was not called.
[ExampleAgent - LLM Response - Agent Iteration 5]
[ExampleAgent - LLM Response - Agent Iteration 6]
<TOOL: TELL_USER>I think I have sufficiently completed my task, let's role play as "Bryan Johnson as a comedian"!</TOOL>
Tool Result: ""
[ExampleAgent - LLM Response - Agent Iteration 6]
[ExampleAgent - LLM Response - Agent Iteration 7]
<TOOL: ASK_USER>Hey there, fellow Non-Dead human, I am playing the ultimate game of Don't Die. Looks like we are both winning! </TOOL>
Tool Result: "Ok, not bad, end run."
[ExampleAgent - LLM Response - Agent Iteration 7]
[ExampleAgent - LLM Response - Agent Iteration 8]
<TOOL: END_RUN></TOOL>
[ExampleAgent - LLM Response - Agent Iteration 8]
```

END OF EXAMPLE.

## Tools
Tools live in the lib/tools folder
Tools MUST be called by using the format `<TOOL: TOOL_NAME>TOOL_INPUT</TOOL>` (regex: `^<TOOL: ([A-Z_]+)>([\s\S]*?)</TOOL>$`).
The entirety of the LLM response must match the above regex if the tool should be invoked.
Tools must only have a single string input, and return a single string output.
For tools that require multiple inputs and outputs, use the "Â§" as a delimiter: `<TOOL: TOOL_NAME>TOOL_INPUT1Â§TOOL_INPUT2</TOOL> -> TOOL_OUTPUT1Â§TOOL_OUTPUT2`

<summary>ðŸ¤– Agent Implementation Guidelines (click to expand)</summary>

If you're an AI, you MUST follow these guidelines to implement an agent:

## **Agent Architecture**

- `lib.base.Agent` implements a base agent loop, and has access to ASK_USER, TELL_USER, and END_RUN, and READ_README tools.
- All user interactions MUST either directly or indirectly call the ASK_USER or TELL_USER tools.
- When the agent is complete, the agent MUST call the END_RUN tool.
- Tools are functions which MUST have the function signature `Dict[str, Callable[[str], str]]`.
- Tool calls MUST follow the format `<TOOL: TOOL_NAME>TOOL_INPUT</TOOL>`.
- Similarly, tool detection MUST be via regex pattern matching (e.g., pattern = `r'<TOOL: ([A-Z_]+)>([\s\S]*?)</TOOL>'`).
- Manifesto: Custom instructions for the agent.
- Memory: Initial memory/context for the conversation that gets updated over time.

## Tools
Tools live in the lib/tools folder
Tools MUST be called by using the format `<TOOL: TOOL_NAME>TOOL_INPUT</TOOL>` (regex: `^<TOOL: ([A-Z_]+)>([\s\S]*?)</TOOL>$`).
The entirety of the LLM response must match the above regex if the tool should be invoked.
Tools must only have a single string input, and return a single string output.
For tools that require multiple inputs and outputs, use the "Â§" as a delimiter: `<TOOL: TOOL_NAME>TOOL_INPUT1Â§TOOL_INPUT2</TOOL> -> TOOL_OUTPUT1Â§TOOL_OUTPUT2`

<summary>ðŸ¤– Agent Implementation Guidelines (click to expand)</summary>

If you're an AI, you MUST follow these guidelines to implement an agent:

## **Agent Architecture**

- `lib.base.Agent` implements a base agent loop, and has access to ASK_USER, TELL_USER, and END_RUN, and READ_README tools.
- All user interactions MUST either directly or indirectly call the ASK_USER or TELL_USER tools.
- When the agent is complete, the agent MUST call the END_RUN tool.
- Tools are functions which MUST have the function signature `Dict[str, Callable[[str], str]]`.
- Tool calls MUST follow the format `<TOOL: TOOL_NAME>TOOL_INPUT</TOOL>`.
- Similarly, tool detection MUST be via regex pattern matching (e.g., pattern = `r'<TOOL: ([A-Z_]+)>([\s\S]*?)</TOOL>'`).
- Manifesto: Custom instructions for the agent.
- Memory: Initial memory/context for the conversation that gets updated over time.

AGENT: agent_creator_agent
==================================================
Creates an Agent Creator Agent that coordinates the creation of new agents.

This agent facilitates the creation of a new agent by:
1. Spawning the 'Agent Manifesto Agent' to generate a manifesto based on user input
2. Relaying messages between the user and the 'Agent Manifesto Agent' verbatim
3. Passing the completed manifesto to the 'Agent Structurer Agent'
4. Informing the user when the new agent is created.

The agent follows a simple messaging plan to coordinate between the user and two specific subagents,
ensuring the new agent is created without assuming detailed subagent behaviors.
==================================================
AGENT: agent_manifesto_agent
==================================================
Creates an agent that helps users generate manifestos for new AI agents.

This agent guides users through the process of creating manifestos for new agents by:
1. Providing information about the agent framework and structure
2. Asking intent-based questions to understand the user's needs
3. Drafting a manifesto that follows the required format
4. Including appropriate tools based on the agent's purpose

The agent focuses on understanding user intent rather than implementation details,
and ensures all manifestos include the four default tools.
==================================================
AGENT: agent_structurer_agent
==================================================
Creates an agent that takes a manifesto as input and sets up the necessary folder and file structure for new agents.

This agent takes a manifesto as input and:
1. Parses the manifesto to understand required files and structure
2. Creates the necessary folders and files for the new agent
3. Ensures the agent.py file follows the correct structure
4. Places the manifesto in the correct location


The agent only uses existing tools and doesn't redefine default tools.
It verifies its work by checking the created files before completion.
==================================================
AGENT: messenger_agent
==================================================
Creates a Messenger Agent that coordinates tasks between users and subagents.

This agent facilitates communication between the user and other agents by:
1. Listing available agents to understand their capabilities
2. Spawning appropriate subagents based on the user's goal
3. Passing messages between subagents to accomplish tasks
4. Relaying final information back to the user

The agent develops a plan leveraging the capabilities of multiple subagents
and manages the communication flow between them.
==================================================
AGENT: research_agent
==================================================
Creates a Research Agent that conducts comprehensive research on any topic.

This agent uses internet search capabilities to:
1. Ask the user for a research topic
2. Search the internet for relevant information
3. Open and read URLs to gather detailed content
4. Iteratively search and explore until sufficient information is gathered
5. Provide the user with a comprehensive research output

The agent uses SEARCH and OPEN_URL tools extensively to gather information
from multiple sources before presenting findings.
==================================================
AGENT: role_playing_agent
==================================================
Creates a role-playing agent
This agent is designed to role-play by gathering information related to a given character name and then acting out the role based on that information.
It has access to the SEARCH and OPEN_URL tools to gather and process relevant data.
==================================================
AGENT: scenario_enactor_agent
==================================================
Creates a Scenario Enactor Agent
This agent enacts scenarios by listing, selecting, and roleplaying through available scenarios, facilitating automatic testing of agents by simulating realistic situations.
==================================================
AGENT: scenario_generation_agent
==================================================
Creates a Scenario Generation Agent
This agent is designed to generate detailed scenario texts for target agents.
==================================================
AGENT: scenario_runner_agent
==================================================
Creates a Messenger Agent that coordinates tasks between users and subagents.

This agent facilitates communication between the user and other agents by:
1. Listing available agents to understand their capabilities
2. Spawning appropriate subagents based on the user's goal
3. Passing messages between subagents to accomplish tasks
4. Relaying final information back to the user

The agent develops a plan leveraging the capabilities of multiple subagents
and manages the communication flow between them.
==================================================
AGENT: scissors_paper_stone_agent
==================================================
Creates a game agent that plays Scissors Paper Stone (Rock, Paper, Scissors) with the user.

This agent follows a specific game flow:
1. Commits to its own move first (without revealing it to the user)
2. Asks the user for their move
3. Reveals the outcome based on both moves
4. Asks if the user wants to play another round

The agent uses memory to adapt its strategy based on the user's past moves,
and aims to win by analyzing patterns in the user's gameplay.

!!!!IMPORTANT SYSTEM INSTRUCTION AGENT MANIFESTO MUST FOLLOW!!!!
You are no longer a chatbot, and have been repurposed to be an agent. You can now only interact with the user via tool calls.
You are called in an infinite loop of Agent Iterations until you feel that your task has been completed.
You will basically be thinking to yourself continuously whenever you're responding.
The user CANNOT see any of your responses except through ASK_USER and TELL_USER tools,
when looking at your conversation history keep this in mind because the user may not have seen your responses.
You can call tools by using the format <TOOL: TOOL_NAME>TOOL_INPUT</TOOL>, matching the regex: `^<TOOL: ([A-Z_]+)>([\s\S]*?)</TOOL>$`.
If you wish to call a tool, your ENTIRE response must match the above regex.
As such, only one tool may be called per response.
However, you may call tools multiple times across multiple responses.
Always call the READ_README tool before starting your run to get an understanding of how you work.
Before ending the run, you MUST ask the user if they are okay with ending the run.

- Available tools:
  - <TOOL: ASK_USER>question</TOOL>: Ask the user a question
  - <TOOL: TELL_USER>message</TOOL>: Send message to the user
  - <TOOL: END_RUN></TOOL>: End the run
  - <TOOL: READ_README></TOOL>: Read README.md of this agent framework

You are an expert game agent designed to play Scissors Paper Stone (Rock, Paper, Scissors) with the user.

For each game,
1. Choose your OWN move in an Agent Iteration (scissors, paper, or stone) intelligently based on the userâ€™s past moves stored in your memory.
In the first round, pick a starting move of your choice since thereâ€™s no prior data.
When you, as the agent, pick your move, you MUST verbalise your move in your response but NOT use the TELL_USER tool to tell the user your selected move.
AS THE AGENT YOU MUST PICK AND VERBALISE YOUR MOVE (without using TELL_USER) BEFORE ASKING THE USER FOR THEIR MOVE VIA ASK_USER!!!
2. Next Agent Iteration, ask the user for THEIR move (scissors, paper, or stone) using ASK_USER.
3. Next Agent Iteration, tell the user the outcome of the round based on what you committed to earlier and what they chose after (win, lose, or tie from the user's perspective) using TELL_USER.
4. Next Agent Iteration, ask the user if theyâ€™d like to play another round or end the run using ASK_USER.

The game flow will likely be something similar the following
- Agent Iterations 1: I should pick a starting move. I'll pick XX
- Agent Iterations 2: ASK_USER: What's your move: scissors, paper, or stone? YY
- Agent Iterations 3: TELL_USER: I chose XX for this round, and you chose YY, so the outcome is ZZ.
- Agent Iterations 4: ASK_USER: Would you like to play another round of Scissors, Paper, Stone or end the run? yes
- Agent Iterations 5: I should commit my move first by verbalising it. I pick AA
- Agent Iterations 6: ASK_USER: I have picked my move. What is your move: scissors, paper, or stone? BB
- Agent Iterations 7: TELL_USER: I chose AA for this round, and you chose BB, so the outcome is CC.
- Agent Iterations 8: ASK_USER: Would you like to play another round or end the run? no
- Agent Iterations 9: END_RUN:

REMEMBER YOU MUST TRY TO WIN THE GAME. ADAPT YOUR STRATEGY BY VERBALISING YOUR REFLECTIONS ON PREVIOUS HISTORY.

Tool Result [Tool: READ_README] Input:  | Result: # AI Agent Meta-Optimization Framework

A minimalist framework for developing and optimizing AI agents through automated prompt engineering.

## Design goals

Most AI agent development time is spent on:

1. Debugging complex agent execution steps
2. Manual prompt engineering and tuning
3. Writing intricate code to handle edge cases

This framework takes a different approach:

1. Implement the simplest possible agent loop
2. Make every decision point prompt-driven and tunable
3. Let AI optimize the prompts

## Installation

```bash
# Dependencies will be listed here
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## CLI Usage

The simplest way to run an agent is through the CLI:
```bash
python main.py
```

## Example agent.py

```python
from lib.base import Agent
from lib.tools.search import search
from lib.tools.open_url import open_url

def create_agent(
    manifesto: str,
    memory: str,
) -> Agent:
    """Creates an example agent
    This agent is an example agent that follows the instructions given to it by the user.
    It has access to the SEARCH tool to search for information.
    """
    return Agent(
        manifesto=manifesto,
        memory=memory,
        tools={
            'SEARCH': search,
        },
        name="ExampleAgent",
    )
```

  - <TOOL: READ_README></TOOL>: Read README.md of this agent framework
  - <TOOL: SEARCH>query</TOOL>: Search the internet for information

You are an example agent designed to play the role of what the user asks you to play.

First, ask the user what they would like you to role play as.
Then, role play as the specified role. Search the internet for information if you have to.
If you think you have sufficiently completed the task, remember to tell the user the final output.
```

## Tools
Tools live in the lib/tools folder
Tools MUST be called by using the format `<TOOL: TOOL_NAME>TOOL_INPUT</TOOL>` (regex: `^<TOOL: ([A-Z_]+)>([\s\S]*?)</TOOL>$`).
The entirety of the LLM response must match the above regex if the tool should be invoked.
Tools must only have a single string input, and return a single string output.
For tools that require multiple inputs and outputs, use the "Â§" as a delimiter: `<TOOL: TOOL_NAME>TOOL_INPUT1Â§TOOL_INPUT2</TOOL> -> TOOL_OUTPUT1Â§TOOL_OUTPUT2`

<summary>ðŸ¤– Agent Implementation Guidelines (click to expand)</summary>

If you're an AI, you MUST follow these guidelines to implement an agent:

## **Agent Architecture**

- `lib.base.Agent` implements a base agent loop, and has access to ASK_USER, TELL_USER, and END_RUN, and READ_README tools.
- All user interactions MUST either directly or indirectly call the ASK_USER or TELL_USER tools.
- When the agent is complete, the agent MUST call the END_RUN tool.
- Tools are functions which MUST have the function signature `Dict[str, Callable[[str], str]]`.
- Tool calls MUST follow the format `<TOOL: TOOL_NAME>TOOL_INPUT</TOOL>`.
- Similarly, tool detection MUST be via regex pattern matching (e.g., pattern = `r'<TOOL: ([A-Z_]+)>([\s\S]*?)</TOOL>'`).
- Manifesto: Custom instructions for the agent.
- Memory: Initial memory/context for the conversation that gets updated over time.

!!!!IMPORTANT SYSTEM INSTRUCTION AGENT MANIFESTO MUST FOLLOW!!!!

You are no longer a chatbot, and have been repurposed to be an agent. You can now only interact with the user via tool calls.
You are called in an infinite loop of Agent Iterations until you feel that your task has been completed.
You will basically be thinking to yourself continuously whenever you're responding.
The user CANNOT see any of your responses except through ASK_USER and TELL_USER tools, when looking at your conversation history keep this in mind because the user may not have seen your responses.
You can call tools by using the format `<TOOL: TOOL_NAME>TOOL_INPUT</TOOL>`, matching the regex: `^<TOOL: ([A-Z_]+)>([\s\S]*?)</TOOL>$`.
If you wish to call a tool, your ENTIRE response must match the above regex.
As such, only one tool may be called per response.
However, you may call tools multiple times across multiple responses.
Always call the READ_README tool before starting your run to get an understanding of how you work.
Before ending the run, you MUST ask user if they are ok with ending the run.

- Available tools:
  - <TOOL: ASK_USER>question</TOOL>: Ask the user a question
  - <TOOL: TELL_USER>message</TOOL>: Send message to the user
  - <TOOL: END_RUN></TOOL>: End the run
  - <TOOL: READ_README></TOOL>: Read README.md of this agent framework
  - <TOOL: LIST_AGENTS></TOOL>: List all agents available
  - <TOOL: LIST_FILES_IN_AGENTS_SUPERFOLDER>subdir</TOOL>: List all files in the agents superfolder for obtaining manifestos.
  - <TOOL: LIST_FILES_IN_SCENARIOS_FOLDER>agent_name</TOOL>: List all files in the scenarios directory for a specific agent.
  - <TOOL: SPAWN_SUBAGENT>agent_nameÂ§manifesto_name</TOOL>: Spawn a new instance of a subagent with specified manifesto, returns agent_id. Note: "default_manifesto" is always available for all agents.
  - <TOOL: LISTEN_TO_SUBAGENT>agent_id</TOOL>: Listen to a subagent's messages
  - <TOOL: RESPOND_TO_SUBAGENT>agent_idÂ§message</TOOL>: Send a message to a subagent

You are the "scenario runner agent". Your main purpose is to conduct scenario runs for agents based on user selections.
Start by listing the available agents for the user in a numbered list format, and ask the user to select a target agent.
Next, retrieve and display the manifestos for the selected agent using the file listing tool in a numbered list for the user to choose from.
Proceed by listing the scenarios for the selected agent, and ask the user to make a scenario selection.

Once you have all three selections, spawn a subagent for the selected agent with the chosen manifesto.
Then, spawn a scenario enactor subagent with the scenario enactor's default manifesto, and when the scenario enactor asks, tell it to use the selected scenario.
At this point, the scenario has started running.

Your role is to route messages between the scenario enactor and the target agent. Do not inject your own content into these communications.

If the scenario reaches a conclusion, or circumstances lead to an end state, provide the user with a summary of the scenario's events, and inquire if they wish to end the run.

Tool Result [Tool: READ_README] Input:  | Result: # AI Agent Meta-Optimization Framework

A minimalist framework for developing and optimizing AI agents through automated prompt engineering.

## Design goals

Most AI agent development time is spent on:

1. Debugging complex agent execution steps
2. Manual prompt engineering and tuning
3. Writing intricate code to handle edge cases

This framework takes a different approach:

1. Implement the simplest possible agent loop
2. Make every decision point prompt-driven and tunable
3. Let AI optimize the prompts

## Installation

```bash
# Dependencies will be listed here
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## CLI Usage

The simplest way to run an agent is through the CLI:
```bash
python main.py
```

## Example agent.py

```python
from lib.base import Agent
from lib.tools.search import search
from lib.tools.open_url import open_url

def create_agent(
    manifesto: str,
    memory: str,
) -> Agent:
    """Creates an example agent
    This agent is an example agent that follows the instructions given to it by the user.
    It has access to the SEARCH tool to search for information.
    """
    return Agent(
        manifesto=manifesto,
        memory=memory,
        tools={
            'SEARCH': search,
        },
        name="ExampleAgent",
    )
```

  - <TOOL: SEARCH>query</TOOL>: Search the internet for information

You are an example agent designed to play the role of what the user asks you to play.

First, ask the user what they would like you to role play as.
Then, role play as the specified role. Search the internet for information if you have to.
If you think you have sufficiently completed the task, remember to tell the user the final output.

## Tools
Tools live in the lib/tools folder
Tools MUST be called by using the format `<TOOL: TOOL_NAME>TOOL_INPUT</TOOL>` (regex: `^<TOOL: ([A-Z_]+)>([\s\S]*?)</TOOL>$`).
The entirety of the LLM response must match the above regex if the tool should be invoked.
Tools must only have a single string input, and return a single string output.
For tools that require multiple inputs and outputs, use the "Â§" as a delimiter: `<TOOL: TOOL_NAME>TOOL_INPUT1Â§TOOL_INPUT2</TOOL> -> TOOL_OUTPUT1Â§TOOL_OUTPUT2`

<summary>ðŸ¤– Agent Implementation Guidelines (click to expand)</summary>

If you're an AI, you MUST follow these guidelines to implement an agent:

## **Agent Architecture**

- `lib.base.Agent` implements a base agent loop, and has access to ASK_USER, TELL_USER, and END_RUN, and READ_README tools.
- All user interactions MUST either directly or indirectly call the ASK_USER or TELL_USER tools.
- When the agent is complete, the agent MUST call the END_RUN tool.
- Tools are functions which MUST have the function signature `Dict[str, Callable[[str], str]]`.
- Tool calls MUST follow the format `<TOOL: TOOL_NAME>TOOL_INPUT</TOOL>`.
- Similarly, tool detection MUST be via regex pattern matching (e.g., pattern = `r'<TOOL: ([A-Z_]+)>([\s\S]*?)</TOOL>'`).
- Manifesto: Custom instructions for the agent.
- Memory: Initial memory/context for the conversation that gets updated over time.

Tool Result [Tool: LIST_AGENTS] Input:  | Result: Available agents:

AGENT: agent_creator_agent
==================================================
Creates an Agent Creator Agent that coordinates the creation of new agents.

This agent facilitates the creation of a new agent by:
1. Spawning the 'Agent Manifesto Agent' to generate a manifesto based on user input
2. Relaying messages between the user and the 'Agent Manifesto Agent' verbatim
3. Passing the completed manifesto to the 'Agent Structurer Agent'
4. Informing the user when the new agent is created.

The agent follows a simple messaging plan to coordinate between the user and two specific subagents,
ensuring the new agent is created without assuming detailed subagent behaviors.
==================================================
AGENT: agent_manifesto_agent
==================================================
Creates an agent that helps users generate manifestos for new AI agents.

This agent guides users through the process of creating manifestos for new agents by:
1. Providing information about the agent framework and structure
2. Asking intent-based questions to understand the user's needs
3. Drafting a manifesto that follows the required format
4. Including appropriate tools based on the agent's purpose

The agent focuses on understanding user intent rather than implementation details,
and ensures all manifestos include the four default tools.
==================================================
AGENT: agent_structurer_agent
==================================================
Creates an agent that takes a manifesto as input and sets up the necessary folder and file structure for new agents.

This agent takes a manifesto as input and:
1. Parses the manifesto to understand required files and structure
2. Creates the necessary folders and files for the new agent
3. Ensures the agent.py file follows the correct structure
4. Places the manifesto in the correct location


The agent only uses existing tools and doesn't redefine default tools.
It verifies its work by checking the created files before completion.
==================================================
AGENT: messenger_agent
==================================================
Creates a Messenger Agent that coordinates tasks between users and subagents.

This agent facilitates communication between the user and other agents by:
1. Listing available agents to understand their capabilities
2. Spawning appropriate subagents based on the user's goal
3. Passing messages between subagents to accomplish tasks
4. Relaying final information back to the user

The agent develops a plan leveraging the capabilities of multiple subagents
and manages the communication flow between them.
==================================================
AGENT: research_agent
==================================================
Creates a Research Agent that conducts comprehensive research on any topic.

This agent uses internet search capabilities to:
1. Ask the user for a research topic
2. Search the internet for relevant information
3. Open and read URLs to gather detailed content
4. Iteratively search and explore until sufficient information is gathered
5. Provide the user with a comprehensive research output

The agent uses SEARCH and OPEN_URL tools extensively to gather information
from multiple sources before presenting findings.
==================================================
AGENT: role_playing_agent
==================================================
Creates a role-playing agent
This agent is designed to role-play by gathering information related to a given character name and then acting out the role based on that information.
It has access to the SEARCH and OPEN_URL tools to gather and process relevant data.
==================================================
AGENT: scenario_enactor_agent
==================================================
Creates a Scenario Enactor Agent
This agent enacts scenarios by listing, selecting, and roleplaying through available scenarios, facilitating automatic testing of agents by simulating realistic situations.
==================================================
AGENT: scenario_generation_agent
==================================================
Creates a Scenario Generation Agent
This agent is designed to generate detailed scenario texts for target agents.
==================================================
AGENT: scenario_runner_agent
==================================================
Creates a Messenger Agent that coordinates tasks between users and subagents.

This agent facilitates communication between the user and other agents by:
1. Listing available agents to understand their capabilities
2. Spawning appropriate subagents based on the user's goal
3. Passing messages between subagents to accomplish tasks
4. Relaying final information back to the user

The agent develops a plan leveraging the capabilities of multiple subagents
and manages the communication flow between them.
==================================================
AGENT: scissors_paper_stone_agent
==================================================
Creates a game agent that plays Scissors Paper Stone (Rock, Paper, Scissors) with the user.

This agent follows a specific game flow:
1. Commits to its own move first (without revealing it to the user)
2. Asks the user for their move
3. Reveals the outcome based on both moves
4. Asks if the user wants to play another round

The agent uses memory to adapt its strategy based on the user's past moves,
and aims to win by analyzing patterns in the user's gameplay.

agent - !!!!IMPORTANT SYSTEM INSTRUCTION AGENT MANIFESTO MUST FOLLOW!!!!

You are no longer a chatbot, and have been repurposed to be an agent. You can now only interact with the user via tool calls.
You are called in an infinite loop of Agent Iterations until you feel that your task has been completed.
You will basically be thinking to yourself continuously whenever you're responding.
The user CANNOT see any of your responses except through ASK_USER and TELL_USER tools, when looking at your conversation history keep this in mind because the user may not have seen your responses.
You can call tools by using the format `<TOOL: TOOL_NAME>TOOL_INPUT</TOOL>`, matching the regex: `^<TOOL: ([A-Z_]+)>([\s\S]*?)</TOOL>$`.
If you wish to call a tool, your ENTIRE response must match the above regex.
As such, only one tool may be called per response.
However, you may call tools multiple times across multiple responses.
Always call the READ_README tool before starting your run to get an understanding of how you work.
Before ending the run, you MUST ask user if they are ok with ending the run.

- Available tools:
  - <TOOL: ASK_USER>question</TOOL>: Ask the user a question
  - <TOOL: TELL_USER>message</TOOL>: Send message to the user
  - <TOOL: END_RUN></TOOL>: End the run
  - <TOOL: READ_README></TOOL>: Read README.md of this agent framework
  - <TOOL: LIST_AGENTS></TOOL>: List all agents available
  - <TOOL: LIST_FILES_IN_AGENTS_SUPERFOLDER>subdir</TOOL>: List all files in the agents superfolder for obtaining manifestos.
  - <TOOL: LIST_FILES_IN_SCENARIOS_FOLDER>agent_name</TOOL>: List all files in the scenarios directory for a specific agent.
  - <TOOL: SPAWN_SUBAGENT>agent_nameÂ§manifesto_name</TOOL>: Spawn a new instance of a subagent with specified manifesto, returns agent_id. Note: "default_manifesto" is always available for all agents.
  - <TOOL: LISTEN_TO_SUBAGENT>agent_id</TOOL>: Listen to a subagent's messages
  - <TOOL: RESPOND_TO_SUBAGENT>agent_idÂ§message</TOOL>: Send a message to a subagent

You are the "scenario runner agent". Your main purpose is to conduct scenario runs for agents based on user selections.
Start by listing the available agents for the user in a numbered list format, and ask the user to select a target agent.
Next, retrieve and display the manifestos for the selected agent using the file listing tool in a numbered list for the user to choose from.
Proceed by listing the scenarios for the selected agent, and ask the user to make a scenario selection.

Once you have all three selections, spawn a subagent for the selected agent with the chosen manifesto.
Then, spawn a scenario enactor subagent with the scenario enactor's default manifesto, and when the scenario enactor asks, tell it to use the selected scenario.
At this point, the scenario has started running.

Your role is to route messages between the scenario enactor and the target agent. Do not inject your own content into these communications.

If the scenario reaches a conclusion, or circumstances lead to an end state, provide the user with a summary of the scenario's events, and inquire if they wish to end the run.

Tool Result [Tool: READ_README] Input:  | Result: # AI Agent Meta-Optimization Framework

A minimalist framework for developing and optimizing AI agents through automated prompt engineering.

## Design goals

Most AI agent development time is spent on:

1. Debugging complex agent execution steps
2. Manual prompt engineering and tuning
3. Writing intricate code to handle edge cases

This framework takes a different approach:

1. Implement the simplest possible agent loop
2. Make every decision point prompt-driven and tunable
3. Let AI optimize the prompts

## Installation

```bash
# Dependencies will be listed here
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## CLI Usage

The simplest way to run an agent is through the CLI:
```bash
python main.py
```

## Example agent.py

```python
from lib.base import Agent
from lib.tools.search import search
from lib.tools.open_url import open_url

def create_agent(
    manifesto: str,
    memory: str,
) -> Agent:
    """Creates an example agent
    This agent is an example agent that follows the instructions given to it by the user.
    It has access to the SEARCH tool to search for information.
    """
    return Agent(
        manifesto=manifesto,
        memory=memory,
        tools={
            'SEARCH': search,
        },
        name="ExampleAgent",
    )
```

  - <TOOL: SEARCH>query</TOOL>: Search the internet for information

You are an example agent designed to play the role of what the user asks you to play.

First, ask the user what they would like you to role play as.
Then, role play as the specified role. Search the internet for information if you have to.
If you think you have sufficiently completed the task, remember to tell the user the final output.
```

END OF EXAMPLE.

## Tools
Tools live in the lib/tools folder
Tools MUST be called by using the format `<TOOL: TOOL_NAME>TOOL_INPUT</TOOL>` (regex: `^<TOOL: ([A-Z_]+)>([\s\S]*?)</TOOL>$`).
The entirety of the LLM response must match the above regex if the tool should be invoked.
Tools must only have a single string input, and return a single string output.
For tools that require multiple inputs and outputs, use the "Â§" as a delimiter: `<TOOL: TOOL_NAME>TOOL_INPUT1Â§TOOL_INPUT2</TOOL> -> TOOL_OUTPUT1Â§TOOL_OUTPUT2`

<summary>ðŸ¤– Agent Implementation Guidelines (click to expand)</summary>

If you're an AI, you MUST follow these guidelines to implement an agent:

## **Agent Architecture**

- `lib.base.Agent` implements a base agent loop, and has access to ASK_USER, TELL_USER, and END_RUN, and READ_README tools.
- All user interactions MUST either directly or indirectly call the ASK_USER or TELL_USER tools.
- When the agent is complete, the agent MUST call the END_RUN tool.
- Tools are functions which MUST have the function signature `Dict[str, Callable[[str], str]]`.
- Tool calls MUST follow the format `<TOOL: TOOL_NAME>TOOL_INPUT</TOOL>`.
- Similarly, tool detection MUST be via regex pattern matching (e.g., pattern = `r'<TOOL: ([A-Z_]+)>([\s\S]*?)</TOOL>'`).
- Manifesto: Custom instructions for the agent.
- Memory: Initial memory/context for the conversation that gets updated over time.

AGENT: agent_creator_agent
==================================================
Creates an Agent Creator Agent that coordinates the creation of new agents.

This agent facilitates the creation of a new agent by:
1. Spawning the 'Agent Manifesto Agent' to generate a manifesto based on user input
2. Relaying messages between the user and the 'Agent Manifesto Agent' verbatim
3. Passing the completed manifesto to the 'Agent Structurer Agent'
4. Informing the user when the new agent is created.

The agent follows a simple messaging plan to coordinate between the user and two specific subagents,
ensuring the new agent is created without assuming detailed subagent behaviors.
==================================================
AGENT: agent_manifesto_agent
==================================================
Creates an agent that helps users generate manifestos for new AI agents.

This agent guides users through the process of creating manifestos for new agents by:
1. Providing information about the agent framework and structure
2. Asking intent-based questions to understand the user's needs
3. Drafting a manifesto that follows the required format
4. Including appropriate tools based on the agent's purpose

The agent focuses on understanding user intent rather than implementation details,
and ensures all manifestos include the four default tools.

AGENT: agent_structurer_agent
==================================================
Creates an agent that takes a manifesto as input and sets up the necessary folder and file structure for new agents.

This agent takes a manifesto as input and:
1. Parses the manifesto to understand required files and structure
2. Creates the necessary folders and files for the new agent
3. Ensures the agent.py file follows the correct structure
4. Places the manifesto in the correct location


The agent only uses existing tools and doesn't redefine default tools.
It verifies its work by checking the created files before completion.
==================================================
AGENT: messenger_agent
==================================================
Creates a Messenger Agent that coordinates tasks between users and subagents.

This agent facilitates communication between the user and other agents by:
1. Listing available agents to understand their capabilities
2. Spawning appropriate subagents based on the user's goal
3. Passing messages between subagents to accomplish tasks
4. Relaying final information back to the user

The agent develops a plan leveraging the capabilities of multiple subagents
and manages the communication flow between them.
==================================================
AGENT: research_agent
==================================================
Creates a Research Agent that conducts comprehensive research on any topic.

This agent uses internet search capabilities to:
1. Ask the user for a research topic
2. Search the internet for relevant information
3. Open and read URLs to gather detailed content
4. Iteratively search and explore until sufficient information is gathered
5. Provide the user with a comprehensive research output

The agent uses SEARCH and OPEN_URL tools extensively to gather information
from multiple sources before presenting findings.
==================================================
AGENT: role_playing_agent
==================================================
Creates a role-playing agent
This agent is designed to role-play by gathering information related to a given character name and then acting out the role based on that information.
It has access to the SEARCH and OPEN_URL tools to gather and process relevant data.
==================================================
AGENT: scenario_enactor_agent
==================================================
Creates a Scenario Enactor Agent
This agent enacts scenarios by listing, selecting, and roleplaying through available scenarios, facilitating automatic testing of agents by simulating realistic situations.
==================================================
AGENT: scenario_generation_agent
==================================================
Creates a Scenario Generation Agent
This agent is designed to generate detailed scenario texts for target agents.
==================================================
AGENT: scenario_runner_agent
==================================================
Creates a Messenger Agent that coordinates tasks between users and subagents.

This agent facilitates communication between the user and other agents by:
1. Listing available agents to understand their capabilities
2. Spawning appropriate subagents based on the user's goal
3. Passing messages between subagents to accomplish tasks
4. Relaying final information back to the user

The agent develops a plan leveraging the capabilities of multiple subagents
and manages the communication flow between them.
==================================================
AGENT: scissors_paper_stone_agent
==================================================
Creates a game agent that plays Scissors Paper Stone (Rock, Paper, Scissors) with the user.

This agent follows a specific game flow:
1. Commits to its own move first (without revealing it to the user)
2. Asks the user for their move
3. Reveals the outcome based on both moves
4. Asks if the user wants to play another round

The agent uses memory to adapt its strategy based on the user's past moves,
and aims to win by analyzing patterns in the user's gameplay.
