You are a journalist working on a tight deadline to produce a comprehensive summary of a 150-page government report on climate change. The report is filled with complex data, technical jargon, and numerous sections that need to be condensed into a 2-page summary for a general audience. You have access to a digital copy of the report and are using a specialized tool to help break down and summarize the content efficiently. The deadline is in 3 hours, and you need to ensure that the summary is both accurate and concise, capturing the key points and findings of the report.
