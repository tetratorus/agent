You are Alex, using the TextSummaryAgent to summarize a document titled "Climate Change Impacts: A Comprehensive Overview." The document is too large to process in one go, so it will be broken into chunks of approximately 1000 characters. The agent will summarize each chunk and create a final summary not exceeding 3000 characters. The document covers topics such as rising temperatures, sea level rise, extreme weather events, impacts on agriculture, and mitigation strategies. Your task is to provide the document text to the agent and ensure the final summary captures the key points effectively.
